# Media Encryption and Decryption in Node.js

This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt image files using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in Node.js.

End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a method of secure communication that ensures that data being sent from one party to another is encrypted in such a way that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read it.
